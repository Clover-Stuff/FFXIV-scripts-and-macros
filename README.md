# FFXIV-scripts-and-macros
Scripts and macros for FFXIV, mostly SND Lua

SND stuff is using the *good* SND fork <https://github.com/Jaksuhn/SomethingNeedDoing>  



All scripts are forever in a state of "I'll improve this when I learn more". Nothing is really "finished". 


There used to be a discord here. Now there's not.
